# Form Manager - Search and Rescue (SAR) Agent Framework - CSC 581

## Introduction

This repository aims to implement a primitive SAR agent for form management, specifically the subset of filling forms with content. It implements a system to fill fields of PDF forms with content as generated by an LLM according the the specifications of the user.

## Examples

Example usage can be found in `tests/test_form_agent.py` to fill out the fall protection plan form specified in `tests/fall-protection-plan-form.pdf`.

```python
agent = FormManager()
test_form = "fall-protection-rescue-plan-form.pdf"
form = PdfReader(test_form)
message = {
    "form": form,
    "content": 'fill out this form with basic fall protection plans, hard hats, etc, for a department called "Five Johns Labor Board" as signed by five Johns',
}
filled_form = agent.process_request(message)
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pyenv (recommended for Python version management)
- pip (for dependency management)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sar-project
```

2. Set up Python environment:
```bash
# Using pyenv (optional)
pyenv install 3.9.6  # or your preferred version
pyenv local 3.9.6

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

4. Configure environment variables:

#### Google Gemini:
- add `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `.env` file

Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control.
